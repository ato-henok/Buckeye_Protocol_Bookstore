# Project 6
## Ruby on Rails Project

## Roles
* Overall Project Manager:Henok Weldemiacel
* Coding Manager:Rui Yan

## Structure of Project
Code is structured as a standard Rails application. All models, views, and controllers are in their appropriate folders. The application.css is used for styling, since every change there is applied to the whole application. Similarly, the application.html with bootstrap is used as the basic layout which applies to all views. 

## How to Execute
* Clone https://github.com/cse3901-osu-2015sp/buckeye_protocol-project_6.git from github
* run "cd bookstore"
* run "rails s"
* run "rake db:migrate"
* home page will be on localhost:port/
You can click on the "All Books" tab to see the book catalog, but if you want to sell or buy book, you have to sign up. When user logs in, there will be 2 additional tabs: "My Books" and "My Orders." 

You can sign up multiple users and have some of them create books. Users will then be able to order other user's book, by hitting "Order" next to the book. 

## Testing
Testing techniques are documented in /bookstore/test/Tes_Plan.txt
