The team test with the following methods:

1. Validations on models
   There are validations on Book, User, and Order models. They test to make sure user input matches the requirement.

2. Rails Testing functionality
   'rake test' is also used to assert the controllers and their methods

3. Testing by using
	   Finally, the team tested by creating multiple users, book, and orders and interacting with the web app. All possible cases were tested, such as:
	   What happens when you don't login and try to view home page?
	   What happens when you go to "My Books" there are no books there?
           What happens when you go to "My Orders" there are no books there?
           Does user get "Thanks" message after buying?
           Does seller get "Congrats" message when their book is ordered?
